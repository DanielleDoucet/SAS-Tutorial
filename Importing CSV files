`input id sources$ type$ weightg;`
`run;`

##must use " " around the file name when importing a .CSV file

##The DSD (Delimiter-Sensitive Data) in infile statement does three things for you. 
1: it ignores delimiters in data values enclosed in quotation marks; 
2: it ignores quotation marks as part of your data; 
3: it treats two consecutive delimiters in a row as missing value. EG-> 1,,2

Firstobs means that the first observation that should be processed is on the 2nd line

adding the $ means that all the data in that column should be processed as a character
